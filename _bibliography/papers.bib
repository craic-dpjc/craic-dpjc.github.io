      abstract={Background: Although surgical resection is the standard therapy for patients with Stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) and those with resectable oligometastasis, recurrence rates exceed 30% and 60%, respectively. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising predictor of recurrence through the detection of molecular residual disease (MRD). However, morphological tissue information remains unseen by ctDNA. Deep Learning (DL) has been shown to be able to predict prognosis directly from routine histomorphology. By integrating MRD status derived from ctDNA with DLâ€“models trained on histomorphology, we aim to improve patient stratification and recurrence detection. Methods: We developed a DL pipeline utilizing vision transformers to predict disease free survival (DFS) based on histological hematoxylin&eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) from n=3321 patients with resectable stage II-IV CRC. This model was trained on the DACHS cohort (n=1766) and subsequently validated on the GALAXY cohort (n=1555). Patients were categorized into high-risk or low-risk groups based on the DL-prediction scores. In the GALAXY cohort, we combined the DL-scores with the MRD status from the four weeks post-surgery to perform survival analysis. The prognostic efficacy of these biomarkers was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and hazard ratios derived from Cox models. Results: In the GALAXY cohort the DL-models categorized 307 patients as high-risk and 1248 patients as low-risk (p<0.001; HR of 2.60, CI 95% 2.11-3.21). ctDNA analysis alone stratified 241 patients as MRD-positive and 1312 patients as MRD-negative (p<0.001; HR of 11.4, CI 95% 9.28-14). Combining these biomarkers, the DFS was significantly stratified in both the MRD-positive group into high-risk (n=81) and low-risk (n=160) with a HR of 1.58 (CI 95% 1.17-2.11; p=0.002) as well as in the MRD negative group into high-risk (n=226) and low-risk (n=1088) with a HR of 2.37 (CI 95% 1.73-3.23; p<0.001). Conclusions: Our results show that even within highly prognostic subsets as yielded by MRD-based stratification, DL is able to further identify patients at high risk of relapse even without measurable MRD. This can be used to improve follow-up and enable early intervention strategies in this vulnerable subset of CRC patients.}
